    "From the [Jupyter Notebook documentation](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "> The notebook extends the console-based approach to interactive computing in a qualitatively new direction, providing a web-based application suitable for capturing the whole computation process: developing, documenting, and executing code, as well as communicating the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter notebook combines two components:\n",
    "> **A web application**: a browser-based tool for interactive authoring of documents which combine explanatory text, mathematics, computations and their rich media output.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Notebook documents** : a representation of all content visible in the web application, including inputs and outputs of the computations, explanatory text, mathematics, images, and rich media representations of objects. The extension of a notebook file is `.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    ">A **notebook** consists of a sequence of **cells**. A cell is a multiline text input field, and its contents can be *executed* by using `Shift-Enter`, or by clicking either the “Play” button the toolbar, or *Cell /Run* in the menu bar. \n",
    "\n",
    "** <div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "The execution behavior of a cell is determined by the cell’s type.\n",
    "</div> **\n",
    "\n",
    "> There are **four** types of cells: **code cells, markdown cells, raw cells** and **heading cells**. Every cell starts off being a code cell, but its type can be changed by using a drop-down on the toolbar (which will be “Code”, initially), or via keyboard shortcuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We mainly use **code cells** and **markdown cell**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code cells\n",
    "\n",
    ">A code cell allows you to edit and write new code, with full syntax highlighting and tab completion. By default, the language associated to a code cell is Python\n",
    ">When a code cell is executed, code that it contains is sent to the kernel associated with the notebook. The results that are returned from this computation are then displayed in the notebook as the cell’s output. The output is not limited to text, with many other possible forms of output are also possible, including matplotlib figures and HTML tables (as used, for example, in the pandas data analysis package). This is known as IPython’s rich display capability.\n",

In IPython this is accomplished by marking up text with the Markdown language. The corresponding cells are called Markdown cells. The Markdown language provides a simple way to perform this text markup, that is, to specify which parts of the text should be emphasized (italics), bold, form lists, etc.\n",

This is made possible by MathJax, which supports a large subset of LaTeX functionality\n",

    "You have to know a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cell modes\n",
    "\n",
    "A cell has two different keyboard input modes. **Edit mode** allows you to type code/text into a cell and is indicated by a **green** cell border. Command mode binds the keyboard to notebook level actions and is indicated by a grey cell border with a **blue** left margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can switch between the two modes simply by pressing  **`Enter`** to activate\n",
    "the command mode and **`Esc`** to activate the edit mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shortcuts\n",
    "\n",
    "Cell commands are available through the tool-bar menu, \n",
    "but there are also simple shortcuts the you must know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Ctrl+Enter`** runs the current cell.  \n",
    "- **`Shift+Enter`** runs the current cell and jumps to the next cell.   \n",
    "- **`Alt+Enter`** runs the cell and adds a new one below it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a cell is in command mode one can use keyboard shortcuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`h`** shows the help menu with all these commands. \n",

    "### Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "When you [run code](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Running%20Code.html), the code is actually executed in a kernel. Sometime a kernel can crash or can get stuck in an endless loop. In all these cases, kernel needs to be interrupted or even restarted. All these operations can be performed by the \"Kernel\" menu.\n",
